# Memory_game
Memory game implemented in python and Kivy library

First of all, excuses for my bad english (:/)

This is a simple app to illustrate a memory game implemented with the Kyvi library
the app is in development stage, where only the widgets have been created, and a "generic" function that tests if all the buttons can use it

I explain that my intuition is not to teach how to install any libraries and packages, I am only demonstrating what I learned

Thanks for watching this project, and if possible comment your opinion and what you would change
