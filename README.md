# Memory_game
Memory game implemented in python and Kivy library

First of all, excuses for my bad english (:/)

This is a simple app to illustrate a memory game implemented with the Kyvi library
the app is in development stage, where only the widgets have been created, and a "generic" function that tests if all the buttons can use it

commit of the day 11 - 21 - 2017
added two images and implemented the raffle of these, assign to dictionary along with Buttons ID's
I modified the method to call the on_press function, it is called by "bt.bing"

now, i need to implement a list that contains the ids of the buttons clicked, and check if they have the same image !? doubts at this point

I explain that my intuition is not to teach how to install any libraries and packages, I am only demonstrating what I learned

Thanks for watching this project, and if possible comment your opinion and what you would change
